# SwitchBrowserWhenSlackIsActive
Use AutoHotKey to detect when Slack is in the foreground, then set the Windows default browser to something else than the browser you use privately.
This of course can be used for any app you use for work or any other purpose. This is my specific purpose.

This depends on this tool: https://kolbi.cz/blog/2017/11/10/setdefaultbrowser-set-the-default-browser-per-user-on-windows-10-and-server-2016-build-1607/

You can also set the default browser through other more elaborate registry hackery, this is just a very convenient way.
